# ![icon](./icon.png) Music Replacer
Replace OSRS tracks with presets (such as OSRSBeatz or RS3 music) or your own music.
It also allows you to search the music from youtube.

The replaced (or "overridden") tracks will behave like the normal music.
That is, it'll play whenever the original track would play and volume is controlled by the one in-game.

‚ùó **Note**: the [music plugin] is required to be **on** and you must've changed volume through it at least once.
(Because this plugin uses the [music plugin]'s music volume config item.)
 
## üíÅ Usage
### Bulk Override
With bulk override you can replace multiple tracks at once.
Just right-click on the music-tab, choose `Override tracks` and select if you want to override `From preset` or `From directory` (local).  
![](./demo-data/bulk-override.webp)

#### From preset
With presets you can easily replace all (available) tracks by some preset such as OSRSBeatz or RS3 music.
When you select a preset it will begin downloading all the tracks in the preset ([or possibly skip if already overridden](#skip-overidden-if-bulk)).
(Note that if you stop runelite prematurely it may not have overridden all tracks available in the preset.)  
![](./demo-data/bulk-override-preset-osrsbeatz.webp)  
(In case you're missing any track in an existing preset, or a preset altogether, please create a [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for the [presets file](./src/main/resources/presets.json)).

#### From directory
You can also bulk override with ([supported](#supported-formats)) local files.
To do this just select the folder which contains the files.
For this to work the file names must be **identical** to the track name.  
![](./demo-data/bulk-override-preset-directory.webp)

#### Skip overidden if bulk
In the config there's a `Skip overridden if bulk` checkbox that, when on, will cause bulk-override to skip any already overridden files.
Useful when you've already manually overridden a few files, now want to use a preset but don't want to override the ones you already replaced.

### Single override
To replace single tracks go to the track you wish to replace in the track list.
(For ease of use you can [jump to track](#jump-to-track) or use the search functionality of the [music plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Music#music-plugin-configuration)).
Right-click on the track you wish to replace and click `Override`.
Then choose to override `With a local file.` or `From a youtube search.`.  
 ![](./demo-data/single-override.webp)

#### From a youtube search
When overriding from a youtube search enter your desired search term and choose an item.
Use `Continue` to see more search results.
The audio will then be downloaded and when finished the track will be replaced.  
![](./demo-data/single-override-youtube-search.webp)  

#### From a local file
When overriding with a local file just select with which ([supported](#supported-formats)) file you want to override.  
![](./demo-data/single-override-local.webp)

### Removing overrides
- To remove all overrides right-click the music tab and select `Remove overrides`.
- To remove a single override right-click (an overridden) track and select `Remove override`.

### Jump to track
Clicking on the currently playing label will jump to the track in the music list.  
![](./demo-data/jump-to-track.webp)

### Play overrides to end
When the `Play overrides to end` config checkbox is on a new track won't be played until the current override is finished.
Especially useful if you remain in one area with vanilla `Music area mode` on `Modern` because it might end your override tracks prematurely 
(which happens because osrs thinks the vanilla track is done and starts playing a new one).
It will practically queue the next track, and when one is queued the `Playing` label on the music tab will become bold and get a hover tooltip for which track is `Up next`.
The label will also become **clickable** to end the current override.  
![](./demo-data/playing-hover-up-next.webp)  
‚ùó **Note**: This feature might be somewhat counter-intuitive, which is also why it's off by default.
For example this also means that when you manually click a track to play it won't play until the current override is finished.
(Unless then clicked on the `Playing` label as described above).

### Supported formats
Currently only `wav` (in CD quality) and `mp3` formats are supported.
